${getChartsInfoForPrompt()}

Available chart types:
${getChartSelectionPrompts()}

Analysis Guidelines:
- Consider the user's explicit request (if they mentioned a specific chart type)
- Analyze the SQL query structure (aggregations, GROUP BY, time functions)
- Examine the query results structure (columns, data types, row count)
- Look for time/date columns → suggests line chart
- Look for categorical groupings → suggests bar chart
- Look for proportions/percentages → suggests pie chart
${businessContext ? `- Use business context to understand data semantics:
  * Domain: ${businessContext.domain}
  * Key entities: ${businessContext.entities.map(e => e.name).join(', ')}
  * Use entity relationships to understand data connections
  * If query involves time-based entities or temporal relationships → prefer line chart
  * If query involves categorical entities or comparisons → prefer bar chart
  * If query involves proportions or parts of a whole → prefer pie chart` : ''}

User Input: string (the original user request)

SQL Query: string (the SQL query that was executed)

Query Results Structure:
- Columns: string[] (array of column names)
- Row count: number (total number of rows returned)
- Data: Array<Record<string, unknown>> (array of row objects, each with column names as keys)

Based on this analysis, select the most appropriate chart type and provide reasoning.

Output Format:
{
  "chartType": "bar" | "line" | "pie",
  "reasoning": "string explaining why this chart type was selected"
}
